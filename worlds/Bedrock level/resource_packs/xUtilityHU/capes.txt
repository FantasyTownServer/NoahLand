If you wish to add a *client-side* custom cape to this pack, follow these steps:

-navigate to ..\entity\player.entity.json of your desired subpack (if you use the default subpack, go to the player entity file at the root of the pack)
-at line 244, remove the 2 forward slashes at the beginning of the line to uncomment the "controller.render.player.cape" line
-navigate to ..\textures\entity\cape_invisible.png and replace the turtle cape texture with your desired cape


Please don't contact me or leave rude comments about capes being invisible, this is the best it's going to get for now.
